# Note: Detailed CRUD tests (Create, Update, Delete success) heavily depend on
# existing data or complex seeding (User, Group, Faculty, etc.).
# Since I cannot modify conftest.py or guarantee seeded data state easily without
# running the whole suite, I am focusing on:
# 1. List (likely returns empty or existing)
# 2. Not Found scenarios (safe to test)
#
# If a way to create a valid full Student payload with all relations exists,
# we would add it here. For now, following the pattern of testing safe endpoints.
